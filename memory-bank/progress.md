## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES

### Build System
- **Issue:** Test source files missing from working tree
  - **Impact:** Cannot build or run test suite
  - **Cause:** Files in git history but not checked out
  - **Status:** Investigation complete, restoration pending
  - **Fix:** Restore from commit 8c5d7f0

- **Issue:** Build directory doesn't exist
  - **Impact:** Cannot compile
  - **Fix:** `rm -rf build && mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..`

### Windows Platform
- **Issue:** Windows build untested on current codebase
  - **Impact:** Unknown deployment readiness
  - **Status:** Awaiting test file restoration
  - **Risk:** Medium (may reveal platform-specific issues)

### Documentation
- **Issue:** 30+ scattered documentation files
  - **Impact:** Confusion for new sessions
  - **Status:** Memory-bank system now addresses this
  - **Fix:** Archiving historical docs in progress

## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

### What Worked Well
- ✅ RLF P⁴ meta-pattern recognition prevented deployment disaster
- ✅ User challenge triggered critical re-analysis (prevented shipping broken system)
- ✅ Documentation accuracy fixes complete (honest scope communication)
- ✅ Multi-domain reasoning caught gap that single-domain missed
- ✅ Memory-bank system provides clear project state

### CRITICAL Lessons (RLF Meta-Learning)
- ⚠️ **Unit tests passing ≠ System integration working** - most important lesson
- ⚠️ Build errors dismissed as "warnings" without investigating impact
- ⚠️ Initial COMP-only thinking led to premature deployment approval
- ⚠️ Repeated exact pattern tests were designed to prevent (beautiful tests, broken integration)
- ⚠️ Evidence gaps critical - no VR hardware, no microphone, no human verification

### Process Improvements Applied
- ✅ RLF boundary recognition (COMP↔SCI weakness revealed evidence gap)
- ✅ P⁴ pattern recognition activated (caught historical failure repetition)
- ✅ Multi-domain activation prevented single-perspective bias
- ✅ User challenges treated as gifts (trigger deeper analysis)
- ✅ STATUS.md updated to reflect accurate deployment status (RED LIGHT)

### Never Repeat
- 🚫 NEVER approve deployment based on unit tests alone
- 🚫 NEVER dismiss build errors without understanding impact
- 🚫 NEVER skip hardware validation for hardware-dependent features
- 🚫 NEVER operate in single-domain mode for critical decisions
