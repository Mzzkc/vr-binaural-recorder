## Core Testing Focus: ASMRtist Workflow

**Primary Validation Target**: Transform microphone input → VR spatial positioning → spatialized audio output

**Critical Test Scenarios**:
1. ✅ **Installation & Launch**: Professional installer experience
2. ✅ **VR Hardware Detection**: Headset integration with fallback to desktop
3. ✅ **Microphone Input**: Audio pipeline validation
4. 🎯 **Core Spatial Positioning**: **CRITICAL** - Virtual microphone positioning in VR space
5. ✅ **Real-time Audio Quality**: <10ms latency spatial processing
6. ✅ **Recording Workflow**: Capture spatial effects for content creation
7. ✅ **Performance & Stability**: Content creation workload validation

**NOT Testing**: Complex VR playground features or technical showcases

## System Requirements

**Supported Platforms**:
- Windows 10 (1903+) or Windows 11 (64-bit only)
- 4GB RAM minimum, 8GB+ recommended
- 500MB free disk space

**Hardware Requirements**:
- **VR headset**: Oculus, HTC Vive, Windows Mixed Reality, or SteamVR compatible
- **Microphone**: Any USB or audio interface microphone
- **Audio output**: Headphones (required for spatial audio validation)

**Optional Components**:
- ASIO-compatible audio interface (for professional audio)
- Virtual audio device driver (for system-wide capture)

## Success Criteria for RC Approval

**Must Pass (Required for Release)**:
- [ ] Installation completes successfully without errors
- [ ] Application launches and runs stably
- [ ] VR headset detection and tracking functional
- [ ] Microphone input detection and processing working
- [ ] **Core spatial positioning workflow functions flawlessly**
- [ ] Real-time spatial audio effects are convincing (<10ms latency)
- [ ] Recording captures spatial effects properly
- [ ] Performance acceptable for content creation use

**Assessment Questions**:
- **Would ASMRtists use this for spatial audio content creation?**
- **Are spatial effects convincing and useful?**
- **Is the workflow intuitive for non-technical users?**
