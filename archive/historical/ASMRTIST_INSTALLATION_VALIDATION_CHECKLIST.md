# ASMRtist Installation & Workflow Validation Checklist

**CRITICAL: DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED - All items must PASS before release**

Jordan Taylor (QA Guardian) - Zero tolerance policy for ASMRtist workflow failures

## Pre-Installation Testing Requirements

### System Requirements ‚úÖ MUST PASS
- [ ] Windows 10 (1903+) or Windows 11 (64-bit only)
- [ ] Minimum 4GB RAM (8GB+ recommended for ASMRtist workflow)
- [ ] 500MB+ free disk space
- [ ] Windows Audio Service running
- [ ] Administrator rights for installer

### Clean System Validation ‚úÖ MUST PASS
- [ ] Fresh Windows installation (VM or clean physical machine)
- [ ] No existing VR software installed
- [ ] No professional audio drivers pre-installed
- [ ] Windows Defender at default settings
- [ ] No previous VR Binaural Recorder installations

## Core Functionality Testing (BLOCKING ISSUES)

### üö´ CRITICAL FAILURES - MUST FIX BEFORE INSTALLER TESTING

#### BLOCKING ISSUE #1: Distance Attenuation Broken ‚ùå
- **Test**: `HRTFProcessorTest.DistanceAttenuation`
- **Current Status**: FAILED (inverted behavior - far objects louder)
- **Required Fix**: Closer microphone positions MUST be louder than far positions
- **ASMRtist Impact**: Moving mic closer to mouth makes audio quieter (WRONG)
- **Validation**: Test MUST pass with rmsFar < rmsNear

#### BLOCKING ISSUE #2: Audio Device Enumeration Missing ‚ùå
- **Test**: `./vr_binaural_recorder --list-devices`
- **Current Status**: Returns "Device listing not yet implemented"
- **Required Fix**: Must show available audio input/output devices
- **ASMRtist Impact**: Cannot select their professional microphones
- **Validation**: Must list at least system default devices with proper names

#### BLOCKING ISSUE #3: Config Parsing Errors ‚ùå
- **Test**: Application startup with config file
- **Current Status**: "Failed to parse config: Missing '}' or object member name"
- **Required Fix**: Robust JSON parsing with error handling
- **ASMRtist Impact**: App crashes with corrupted config files
- **Validation**: Must start successfully with default config

## Installation Process Validation

- [ ] Audio interface selection functional in UI
- [ ] Multiple microphone support validated
- [ ] Audio device switching without restart

### Spatial Audio Processing ‚úÖ MUST PASS
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Distance attenuation works correctly (closer = louder)
- [ ] VR head tracking updates spatial positioning
- [ ] HRTF processing produces different left/right channels
- [ ] Real-time spatial audio with <10ms latency
- [ ] Audio quality maintained throughout processing chain

### VR Integration Testing ‚úÖ MUST PASS
- [ ] SteamVR/OpenVR runtime detection
- [ ] VR headset tracking functional (HMD + controllers)
- [ ] SteamVR overlay mode operational
- [ ] Graceful fallback to desktop mode without VR hardware
- [ ] Controller-based microphone positioning

### Real-World ASMRtist Scenarios ‚úÖ MUST PASS
- [ ] **Scenario 1**: Connect USB microphone ‚Üí select in app ‚Üí record spatial audio
- [ ] **Scenario 2**: Move microphone in VR space ‚Üí hear distance changes
- [ ] **Scenario 3**: Walk around with HMD ‚Üí microphone follows spatial position
- [ ] **Scenario 4**: Switch between different microphones mid-session
- [ ] **Scenario 5**: Export recorded spatial audio with proper L/R channels

## Application Functionality Testing

### Launch and Startup ‚úÖ MUST PASS
- [ ] Application launches successfully from Start Menu
- [ ] Version information displays correctly (`--version`)
- [ ] Help system functional (`--help`)
- [ ] Configuration loading successful
- [ ] Error-free startup in Windows Event Log

### UI/UX Validation ‚úÖ MUST PASS
- [ ] SteamVR overlay interface responsive
- [ ] Desktop mode GUI functional (fallback)
- [ ] Configuration changes persist between sessions
- [ ] Professional appearance suitable for ASMRtist workflow
- [ ] Error messages clear and actionable

### Performance Testing ‚úÖ MUST PASS
- [ ] Audio processing latency <10ms
- [ ] VR tracking updates at 90Hz minimum
- [ ] CPU usage reasonable during recording
- [ ] Memory consumption stable over extended sessions
- [ ] No audio dropouts or glitches

## Uninstallation Testing

### Complete Removal ‚úÖ MUST PASS
- [ ] Uninstaller removes all application files
- [ ] Registry entries completely cleaned
- [ ] Start Menu shortcuts removed
- [ ] No leftover files in Program Files
- [ ] System restored to pre-installation state

## Hardware Compatibility Testing

### Professional Audio Equipment ‚úÖ MUST PASS
- [ ] USB microphones (Blue Yeti, Audio-Technica AT2020USB+)
- [ ] Audio interfaces (Focusrite, PreSonus, Zoom)

- [ ] SteamVR crash recovery
- [ ] Corrupted configuration file recovery
- [ ] Insufficient system resources graceful degradation

### Security & Antivirus ‚úÖ MUST PASS

- [ ] No sensitive data exposure in logs

## BLOCKING CRITERIA - MUST BE ZERO FAILURES

### Critical Failures That Block Release:
1. ‚ùå **Distance attenuation test failure** (currently failing)
2. ‚ùå **Missing --list-devices implementation** (currently not implemented)
3. ‚ùå **Config parsing errors** (currently failing)
4. ‚ùå **No audio device selection** (currently missing)
5. ‚ùå **Failed ASMRtist core workflow** (currently broken)

### Mandatory Success Rate:
- **Automated Tests**: 100% pass rate (currently 21/22 = 95.5% ‚ùå)
- **Installation Success**: 100% on clean systems
- **ASMRtist Workflow**: 100% functional end-to-end
- **Uninstallation**: 100% clean removal

**JORDAN TAYLOR VERDICT**: üö´ **DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED**

**Current Status**: 4 critical blocking issues prevent installer creation
**Required Action**: Fix all core audio functionality before proceeding
**Timeline Impact**: Cannot meet deployment schedule until fixes implemented

**No Windows installer should be created until this checklist shows 100% PASS rate.**
