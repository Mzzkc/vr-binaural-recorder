# DEVELOPMENT GOVERNANCE PROCEDURES
**Preventing Architectural Drift and Ensuring Vision Alignment**

**Date:** September 24, 2025
**Authority:** Project Manager & Solution Architect
**Status:** MANDATORY COMPLIANCE

---

## PURPOSE AND SCOPE

This document establishes **mandatory procedures** to prevent the architectural drift that led to building a recording application instead of an audio routing system. All development activities must comply with these procedures.

### Enforcement Level
- **MANDATORY** for all code changes
- **MANDATORY** for all configuration updates
- **MANDATORY** for all documentation creation
- **VIOLATIONS** will trigger immediate work stoppage and review

---

## CORE GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES

### Principle 1: Use Case Validation
**RULE:** Every component must directly serve audio routing/transformation

**Validation Questions for ALL Development:**
1. Does this help route audio between applications?
2. Does this apply real-time spatial transformations?
3. Does this provide VR control over audio processing?

**AUTOMATIC REJECTION if component:**
- Manages recording sessions
- Handles file I/O in audio path
- Provides recording quality/format options
- Implements take management or playback

### Principle 2: Real-Time Safety
**RULE:** Audio processing must be real-time safe with no blocking operations

**Requirements:**
- Zero memory allocations in audio callback
- No file I/O in audio processing thread
- Lock-free data structures for shared state
- <10ms total system latency

### Principle 3: Simplicity First
**RULE:** Choose the simplest solution that meets requirements

**Guidelines:**
- Use existing APIs instead of custom implementations
- Target <5,000 lines total codebase
- <20 configuration parameters maximum
- Minimal abstraction layers

---

## PRE-DEVELOPMENT PROCEDURES

### 1. Component Design Review (MANDATORY)

**REQUIRED BEFORE ANY CODING:**

**Template:** Create `DESIGN_REVIEW_[ComponentName].md`
```markdown
# Component Design Review: [ComponentName]

```

**APPROVAL REQUIRED:** Must have all checkboxes completed and three approvals before coding begins.

### 2. API Design Review (MANDATORY for Public Interfaces)

**EXAMPLES:**

**✅ APPROVED API:**
```cpp
class SpatialAudioEngine {
public:
    void ProcessAudioBlock(const float* input, float* output, size_t frames);
    void UpdateSpatialParameters(float mix, bool enableHRTF);
    void UpdateListenerPose(const VRPose& pose);
};
```

**❌ REJECTED API:**
```cpp
class AudioEngine {
public:
    bool StartRecording(const std::string& filename);    // VIOLATION: Recording
    void PauseRecording();                               // VIOLATION: Recording
    void SetRecordingQuality(int quality);              // VIOLATION: Recording
};
```

2. "Are you adding any recording functionality?" (If yes → STOP WORK)
3. "Are you using existing APIs or building custom solutions?"
4. "Will your changes affect real-time audio performance?"
5. "How many lines of code are you adding?" (>100/day requires review)

## AUTOMATED ENFORCEMENT

### 1. Git Hooks (MANDATORY)

**Pre-commit Hook** (`scripts/pre-commit-governance.sh`):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Architectural governance pre-commit hook

echo "🔍 Running architectural compliance checks..."

# Check for recording functionality
if git diff --cached --name-only | xargs grep -l "Recording\|Record\|Session" 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: Recording functionality detected"
    echo "This violates architectural principles"
    echo "Remove recording code before committing"
    exit 1
fi

# Check for file I/O in audio code
if git diff --cached | grep -E "fopen|ofstream|WriteFile|iostream" -- "*/audio/*" 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: File I/O detected in audio code"
    echo "This violates real-time safety requirements"
    exit 1
fi

# Check configuration parameter count
CONFIG_PARAMS=$(grep -o '"[^"]*":' config/vr_binaural_config.json | wc -l)
if [ "$CONFIG_PARAMS" -gt 25 ]; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: Too many configuration parameters ($CONFIG_PARAMS)"
    echo "Maximum allowed: 25, Current: $CONFIG_PARAMS"
    echo "Review and simplify configuration"
    exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Architectural compliance checks passed"
```

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline Checks

**Build Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/governance.yml`):
```yaml
name: Architectural Governance

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  governance-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Check for recording violations
      run: |
        if grep -r "StartRecording\|StopRecording\|RecordingSession" src/; then
          echo "ERROR: Recording functionality detected"
          exit 1
        fi

    - name: Check real-time safety
      run: |
        if grep -r "new\|malloc\|make_unique" src/audio/*callback*; then
          echo "ERROR: Memory allocation in audio callback"
          exit 1
        fi

    - name: Validate configuration complexity
      run: |
        PARAMS=$(grep -o '"[^"]*":' config/vr_binaural_config.json | wc -l)
        if [ "$PARAMS" -gt 25 ]; then
          echo "ERROR: Too many config parameters: $PARAMS"
          exit 1
        fi
```
