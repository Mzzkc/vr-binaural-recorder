‚ö†Ô∏è Integration testing needs complete environment

## Recommendations for Shipping Readiness

### Immediate Priorities
1. Complete VR runtime integration
2. Implement full audio processing pipeline
3. Develop comprehensive error handling
4. Create robust configuration validation
5. Expand test coverage

### Secondary Priorities
1. Performance profiling and optimization
2. Cross-platform compatibility testing
3. User interface development
4. Documentation updates
5. Installer and packaging improvements

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: VR and audio system integration
- **Medium Risk**: Cross-platform support
- **Low Risk**: Build system and dependency management

## Estimated Time to Shipping
- With dedicated resources: 2-3 months (significantly reduced)
- Minimum viable product: 3-6 weeks
- Hardware validation phase: 2-4 weeks

## Current Blockers
1. VR hardware availability for integration testing
2. Professional audio hardware for latency validation
3. Cross-platform build environment setup
4. Performance optimization requiring target hardware

## Conclusion
**SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS - APPROACHING BETA STATE**

The project has made significant development progress with all core components substantially implemented. Primary remaining work involves hardware integration, performance optimization, and cross-platform validation rather than fundamental feature development.
